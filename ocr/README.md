# OCR

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a long-standing research problem. Existing approaches
are based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image understanding and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
for char-base processing.

[TrOCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10282) offers end-to-end text recognition approach with Transformer
archictecture for both image understanding and wordpiece-level text generation.
